### Hi there I am @MadHead34 (Real Name: Ming Huang) ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Mission Ready Software Developer Candidate from Auckland, NZ. 

I have graduated in Auckland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science, majored in Software Development in 2020.

I am currently in Mission Ready doing Full Stack Developer Accelerator Programme where I mainly use programming languages and tools such as React, 
JavaScript, C#, NodeJS, MongoDB, Microsoft Azure, Chatbot Google DialogFlow, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, SQL, .Net Core, .NET WEBAPI and Dockers.

Besides these languages and tools from above, I have experience with Java, Python and Gherkin Language for Cucumber Tool and I have experience with Automation/Manual Testing frameworks such as TravisCI, Selenium, Robot Framework and Kofax Total Agility.

I am mainly focusing more on Full Stack Development but however I am more than open to other roles like Software Developer, Automation Developer and Integration Developer.

I do have industry experience coming from ANZ as an Automation Developer where my task is to run test for the login credentials, automated the test for the client's loans and also done intergration testing in C# and .Net on the home loan from the client as well. I have also done a project with a client Bee Intelligence where i worked with a team to create a Mobile Application for Android which is a Reporting and Dashboard Application.

I hope to learn more from this tech world and it is always exciting and fun to learn more from new tech skills. I am not the best at programming but what makes programming and doing tech stack really great is there is always continuous improvements and every tools change every year which gives me opportunity to adapt more and 
learn more of these fascinating tech tools. I also love going with the anonymous as there is unknown result but there will be a greater reward hidden in there that is waiting to emerge once the solution has arrived and it is great to have patience for this long journey.

Besides being a tech aspirer, I have other interests such as Gym, Puzzles, Car, Sneakers and Video Games. So feel free to look at my profile and see what I have done for the projects and some other projects I will do
